# Notes-App-CICD
<img src=""></img>

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on automating the deployment of a Notes App. The code, stored on GitHub, is cloned, a Docker image is created and pushed to Docker Hub, and then the application is hosted.

## Key Steps:
1. **Code Management:** 
   - Stored the Notes App code on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
2. **Containerization:** 
   - Created a Docker image of the Notes App, ensuring a consistent and reliable environment.
3. **Image Repository:** 
   - Pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub for easy access and deployment.
4. **Deployment:** 
   - Hosted the Notes App using the Docker image.

## Troubleshooting and Learnings:

üîß **Docker not able to connect Jenkins User:**
   - **Challenge:** When running the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, it executes as the Jenkins user, which lacks default permission to run Docker commands.
   - **Solution:** Added the Jenkins user to the Docker user group to grant necessary permissions.
   - ```sudo usermod -aG jenkins docker```

üîí **Security of Credentials:**
   - **Challenge:** Securely managing sensitive credentials and environment variables.
   - **Solution:** Created environment variables to handle sensitive information securely within the pipeline. 


‚öôÔ∏è **Application Robustness:**
   - **Challenge:** Encountered an "Application Port already occupied" error.
   - **Solution:** Used Docker-Compose settings instead of individual Docker run commands to manage application ports efficiently and avoid conflicts.

üì° **Automated Rebuilds with GitHub Webhooks:**
   - **Challenge:** Ensuring the application rebuilds automatically upon code changes.
   - **Solution:** Implemented GitHub webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds whenever a new commit is pushed to the GitHub repository, ensuring the application is always up-to-date.

## Technologies Used:
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **CI/CD Tool:** Jenkins
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Container Orchestration:** Docker Compose
- **Image Repository:** Docker Hub

## Dockerfile : 
```
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app/backend

COPY requirements.txt /app/backend
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . /app/backend

EXPOSE 8000

CMD python /app/backend/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Jenkins Pipeline : 
```
pipeline {
    agent any 
    
    stages{
        stage("Clone Code"){
            steps {
                echo "Cloning the code"
                git url:"https://github.com/LondheShubham153/django-notes-app.git", branch: "main"
            }
        }
        stage("Build"){
            steps {
                echo "Building the image"
                sh "docker build -t my-note-app ."
            }
        }
        stage("Push to Docker Hub"){
            steps {
                echo "Pushing the image to docker hub"
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId:"dockerHub",passwordVariable:"dockerHubPass",usernameVariable:"dockerHubUser")]){
                sh "docker tag my-note-app ${env.dockerHubUser}/my-note-app:latest"
                sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerHubUser} -p ${env.dockerHubPass}"
                sh "docker push ${env.dockerHubUser}/my-note-app:latest"
                }
            }
        }
        stage("Deploy"){
            steps {
                echo "Deploying the container"
                sh "docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d"                
            }
        }
    }
}
```


## Learnings:
- Ensured smooth and secure deployment processes.
- Improved my understanding of user permissions and environment variable management.
- Enhanced the robustness and reliability of Dockerized applications.
- Gained valuable experience with GitHub webhooks for automated rebuilds.
